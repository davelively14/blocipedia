# Blocopedia

User created, markdown-based wikis.

## Overview

This application allows users to create public and private Markdown-based wikis using Ruby on Rails. We used Devise for user authentication, Pundit for authorization, Stripe for payment, and Redcarpet for rendering the Markdowns.

## How to Run

From the command line, run:

```
$ rails s
```

Once the server starts, navigate to http://localhost:3000/.
